    <p>Spinning out on what to say or what to do</p>
     <p>Finding reasons</p>
     <p>Finding reasons for my constant change in mood</p>
     <p>Said, "I'll see it to believe it," but who knows the actual truth?</p>
     <p>'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure</p>
     <br>
     <p>'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches</p>
     <p>And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets</p>
     <p>Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in</p>
     <p>'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure</p>
     <br>
     <p>Find it hard to say, I know that I'm alright</p>
     <p>Took a while for me to finally realize</p>
     <p>That when I see it, I'll believe it, giving me a peace of mind</p>
     <p>I'm sure now, I'm sure</p>
     <br>
     <p>'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches</p>
     <p>And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets</p>
     <p>Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in</p>
     <p>'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure</p>
     <br>
     <p>'Cause some days I'm afraid to fall down</p>
     <p>But I understand the coming outcome</p>
     <p>Pick it up if I allow it</p>
     <p>Can't help it, can't help</p>
     <br>
     <p>'Cause days blend to one when I'm on the right beaches</p>
     <p>And the walls painted white, they tell me all the secrets</p>
     <p>Don't wait for the tide just to dip both your feet in</p>
     <p>'Cause I'm sure now, I'm sure</p>
